        <p>Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been <br>stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean <br>towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over <br>the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold <br>that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a <br>laughter more terrible than any sadness—a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of <br>the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was <br>the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and <br>the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.<br><br></p>     
        <p>But there was life, abroad in the land and defiant. Down the frozen waterway toiled a <br>string of wolfish dogs. Their bristly fur was rimed with frost. Their breath froze in the air <br>as it left their mouths, spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of <br>their bodies and formed into crystals of frost. Leather harness was on the dogs, and <br>leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along behind. The sled was without <br>runners. It was made of stout birch-bark, and its full surface rested on the snow. The front <br>end of the sled was turned up, like a scroll, in order to force down and under the bore of <br>soft snow that surged like a wave before it. On the sled, securely lashed, was a long and <br>narrow oblong box. There were other things on the sled—blankets, an axe, and a coffee-<br>pot and frying-pan; but prominent, occupying most of the space, was the long and <br>narrow oblong box.<br><br></p> 
        <p>In advance of the dogs, on wide snowshoes, toiled a man. At the rear of the sled toiled a <br>second man. On the sled, in the box, lay a third man whose toil was over,—a man whom <br>the Wild had conquered and beaten down until he would never move nor struggle again. <br>It is not the way of the Wild to like movement. Life is an offence to it, for life is <br>movement; and the Wild aims always to destroy movement. It freezes the water to <br>prevent it running to the sea; it drives the sap out of the trees till they are frozen to their <br>mighty hearts; and most ferociously and terribly of all does the Wild harry and crush into <br>submission man—man who is the most restless of life, ever in revolt against the dictum <br>that all movement must in the end come to the cessation of movement.<br><br></p> 
        <p>But at front and rear, unawed and indomitable, toiled the two men who were not yet <br>dead. Their bodies were covered with fur and soft-tanned leather. Eyelashes and cheeks <br>and lips were so coated with the crystals from their frozen breath that their faces were <br>not discernible. This gave them the seeming of ghostly masques, undertakers in a <br>spectral world at the funeral of some ghost. But under it all they were men, penetrating <br>the land of desolation and mockery and silence, puny adventurers bent on colossal <br>adventure, pitting themselves against the might of a world as remote and alien and <br>pulseless as the abysses of space.<br><br></p>
